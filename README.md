# WrapT - Image Denoising Using Deep Learning

WrapT is a Python-based image processing project that aims to generate noisy images and implement denoising algorithms using deep learning techniques. The project provides a user-friendly interface for generating synthetic noisy images and applying denoising algorithms to enhance image quality.

## Features:

- Generate synthetic noisy images with adjustable noise levels.
- Implement state-of-the-art denoising algorithms using deep learning.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different denoising algorithms.
- Visualize the denoising results and compare them with ground truth images.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface and interactive GUI for seamless operation.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avanishrai30/WrapT---Image-Denoising-Using-Deep-Learning.git
   cd wrapT
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

## Usage:

1. Launch the application using the command above.

2. Use the GUI to generate noisy images and select denoising algorithms.

3. View the denoising results and compare them with the original images.
